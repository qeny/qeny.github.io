# qeny.github.io

My personal page on GitHub.

In its previous incarnations, this was hosted on qeny.net and then
qeny-home.appspot.com for a brief period of time.

I have now decided to move it here, since the whole purpose was originally
to experiment with HTML and JavaScript and to have a place on the web
to put a few random personal things.
