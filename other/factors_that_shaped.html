<p>From the time of the earliest Chinese writing, the Chinese script has
developed and changed in a unique way. Why has it taken the form that it has?
It has been surely influenced by the nature of spoken Chinese language.
Expanding purposes for determined how it grew in complexity. Other
characteristics of Chinese writing have been influenced by the media with
which it has been written. Throughout the centuries, Chinese writing has been
shaped by the various forces in its environment.</p>

<p>Writing in China started out in a way very similar to the way that other
writing systems started; early humans represented things in the world by
drawing pictures of them. At the origin of human writing, there was no
difference between writing and drawing. In order for a writing system to
expand beyond pictographs of physical things, there needs to be a way to write
words for abstract things. If the abstract word that you want to write sounds
the same as a word for which there is already a pictograph, you can use this.
This is called paronomastic use, and it results in a symbol with one sound but
several meanings, which is called polysemous. Likewise, if the word that you
want to write is related in meaning to a symbol you already have, you can use
this; this results in a symbol with basically one meaning but more than one
sound, and this is called polyphonic.</p>

<p>As a result of these two methods of writing new words, there are two types
of ambiguous graphs. This ambiguity can be resolved by adding a symbol to a
polysemous character to indicate meaning, or adding a symbol to a polyphonic
character to indicate sound. Either of these approaches helps to determine
what word you mean to write. Boltz summarizes the whole process by saying that
"... when writing arises ex nihilo it is largely pictographic in its earliest
stage, and it then evolves through the twin devices of paronomasia and
polyphony and the subsequent use of determinatives." (Boltz 431)</p>

<p>Unlike most other early writing systems, however, Chinese writing did not
subsequently become a phonetic system; it came to pass that writing in
"Mesopotamia and Egypt ... moved away from a logographic script to become
first syllabographic, and in some cases eventually alphabetic" (Boltz 424).1
This happend for a couple of reasons. The spoken Chinese language does not
have the inflection that other languages do, and the languages of China are
related to each and thus have similar features, unlike languages in other
regions: "It was the inflected nature of [the Japanese language] that had
encouraged the Japanese ... to develop a spelling system ... The Chinese
lacked such a stimulus, just as they lacked the stimulus that had been present
in ancient Mesopotamia, of having to write two such entirely dissimilar
languages as Sumerian and Akkadian." (Keightley 192) So, there were pressures
for other early writing systems to become phonographic that weren't present
for Chinese, and thus Chinese writing remained logographic.</p>

<p>Another possible reason why Chinese writing did not develop into a
syllabary or alphabet was that this would have resulted in a great amount of
ambiguity due to the large number of homophones in spoken Chinese language.
Using logographs rather than a phonetic writing system allows the writing to
unambiguously denote various homophones.2 Writing words purely with a
syllabary would have created more ambiguity, so it wasn't done; other
languages with fewer homophones, however, would not have this problem. Thus,
the Chinese writing system developed to be suited to writing the spoken
Chinese language.</p>

<p>By the time of the oracle bone inscriptions and bronze script in the Shang
dynasty, the principles of the writing system were established, but the form
of the characters was still evolving; the specific forms that it took were
shaped by how it was written. On bronze, one can inscribe curved lines without
much difficulty; "cast in bronze, the shape of individual strokes, indeed the
form of the whole character, can be freer than those of characters incised on
a surface as hard as bone or shell." (Boltz 424) This caused a difference in
the appearance of the characters: "Consequently OBI characters give the
impression of being rough and angular, with a strong predominance of straight
lines." (Boltz 424) This is an example of the general principle that the
medium of writing shapes the form of the writing.</p>

<p>The lesser seal script that was standardized in the Qin dynasty was
influenced by what it was used for. Although it was used for multiple
different purposes, it was influenced by its use in seals. The medium and
purpose of a seal has requirements and restrictions that shape the appearance
of seal characters. When writing characters for the purpose of being a seal,
the characters must fit into a small square or rectangle, and must appear
balanced. Because a seal is carved into a hard surface, lines should be
relatively straight and there should be a certain distance between lines. Thus
the lesser seal script has these attributes.</p>

<p>The needs for the writing system changed though; writing was increasingly
done for more mundane purposes than seals and ritual carvings, and it was
increasingly done with brush-pens. It developed so that it was "suited to the
needs of clerks who staffed the growing imperial bureaucracy of the Han
dynasty." (Keightley 175) Wong suggested that the use of the brush-pen also
promoted the clerical script: "The Clerical Script and the brush-pen made a
truly congenial partnership all at once." (Wong 20) Clerical script is easier
to write, and write quickly, with a brush-pen than other scripts such as
lesser seal script, which surely helped it to become popular.</p>

<p>The development of the grass script, like the clerical script, was a
consequence of the greater volume of writing that was done by some people,
together with the brush that was used. Wong described how it first developed:
"In the course of time, the bristle brush completely supplanted all else as a
writing implement. Accomplished scholars, who knew their characters well,
wrote with hardly any hesitation ...  The inevitable result was a thin trail
connecting stroke to stroke, and linking character to character" (Wong 21).
This is, of course, similar to the reason why cursive writing with Roman
letters developed; both cursive Chinese and Roman characters had been modified
in form so that they are faster to write.</p>

<p>The direction of writing was also influenced by medium. Bamboo slips were
in common use in China before the widespread use of paper, and this influenced
the way that Chinese was written. It was simply convenient to write top to
bottom, right to left, with bamboo slips, because then they wouldn't get in
the way: "Narrow slivers of bamboo restricted writing to one character at a
time, proceeding from top to bottom. More people wrote with the right hand
than the left. Therefore unwritten slips, were places on the left." (Wong 94)
When paper came into use, there was no pressing reason to change the direction
of writing, so writing top to bottom, right to left continued to be a common
convention.</p>

<p>The Chinese writing system which is used today was shaped by the languages
that it has been used to write, the purposes which it's been used for in the
past and the media that it was written with in the past. While the basic
principles of the Chinese script have long been fixed, there are still changes
taking place. One of the largest changes in the media used to write Chinese
recently has been the use of the computer. This has enabled the characters to
easily take on new appearances in new fonts, such as a straight blocky
appearance or bubbly appearance. Despite these small changes, the unique
Chinese script remains fundamentally the same as it was when it was developed
in ancient times.</p>
