<h1>The War on File Sharing</h1>

<!-- introduction -->
<p>On October 4th, 2007, the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) sued Jammie Thomas, a single
mother, for $222,000, for downloading 24 songs, as part of
their crusade against illegal online file sharing.<sup><a
href='#1'>1</a></sup> The RIAA and similar groups claim
to be defending artists and protecting music by suing
file sharers, but are their actions doing any good?</p>

<!-- effect on sales -->
<p>The basis of the argument
against file sharing is that it makes it impossible for
artists to make money because people download music rather
than pay for CDs. Mitch Bainwol, the CEO of the RIAA,
says that "the root cause for this drastic decline in
record sales is the astronomical rate of music piracy
on the Internet."<sup><a href='#2'>2</a></sup> However,
others, such as George Ziemann, argue that file sharing
is just one of many factors, including changes in
the economy, increases in price, and decreases in the
number of releases.<sup><a href='#3'>3</a></sup> Also,
file sharing may actually increase sales in some cases
by allowing people to sample things before buying.

<!-- benefits -->
<p>Whether or not file sharing is
harmful to artists, it does benefit society in some
ways. It allows people to access to a huge amount of
information and art that people would not otherwise have
access to. Rufus Pollock, an economist at Cambridge
University, wrote, "for each such consumer society
gains the entire value they put upon the good (net of
costs). Aggregating the valuations of all of these
individuals who only get access at the lower price
gives the total value to society of having this lower
price."<sup><a href='#4'>4</a></sup> With more access to
something, there is more benefit from it. File sharing has
the additional benefit that it allows almost anybody to
get a message to a wide audience and become popular.</p>

<!-- solutions -->
<p>Even if everyone stopped buying CDs,
artists could still make money in a variety of ways. One
way, which the Electronic Frontier Foundation has
suggested, is known as collective licensing: "The concept
is simple: the music industry forms a collecting society,
which then offers file-sharing music fans the opportunity
to "get legit" in exchange for a reasonable regular
payment, say $5 per month."<sup><a href='#5'>5</a></sup>
Some artists could also make money through donations;
for example, Radiohead offered their latest album without
requiring payment. Eliot Van Buskirk mentions estimates
that they may have made $6-$10 million after only a
very short period of time.<sup><a href='#6'>6</a></sup>
If so, this method of asking for donations has clearly
worked well. In addition to methods such as collective
licensing and donations, artists can also make money
with live shows and merchandise.</p>

<!-- lawsuit effectiveness -->
<p>Even if file sharing
was a serious problem, the efforts to fight it have been
pointless simply because they have failed miserably. A
study by the Cooperative Association for Internet
Data Analysis, and a few other groups, concluded that
traffic in networks that are used for file sharing
"represents a significant amount of Internet traffic
and is likely to continue to grow in the future, RIAA
behavior notwithstanding."<sup><a href='#7'>7</a></sup>
Years of lawsuits and other attempts to fight file
sharing have apparently not worked very well.</p>

<!-- conclusion -->
<p>The current fight against file
sharing should not and can not continue. Instead, we
should focus on making sure that artists get paid while
file sharing continues, whether it be through collective
licensing, or some other way. When this is done, we can
get the benefit of free and open access to information
and media, which file sharing provides, while artists
can make a living. In any case, lawsuits are certainly
not doing any good.</p>
